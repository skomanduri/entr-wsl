.Sh NAME
.Nm entr
.Nd run arbitrary commands when files change
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dr
.Op Fl c
.Ar utility
.Op Ar argument ...
.Op Ar /_
.Nm entr
.Ar +fifo
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss EXEC Mode
.Nm entr
has two modes of operation; the first use reads a list of files provided on STDIN
and executes the supplied
.Ar utility
if any of them change.
.Nm
waits for the child process to finish before responding to subsequent file
system events. A TTY is also opened before entering the watch loop in order to
support interactive utilities.
.Pp
.Ar -d
track directories and the paths to regular files provided as input. In this
mode entr will exit with status code 0 if a new file is created.
.Pp
.Ar -r
launch the
.Ar utility
at startup and reload it by sending
.Dv SIGTERM
if one of the source files change.
.Nm
waits for the
.Ar utility
to exit to ensure that resources such as sockets have been closed.
.Pp
A limited number of features are provided to reduce keystrokes.
.Pp
.Ar -c
execute
.Pa /usr/bin/clear
before invoking the
.Ar utility
specified on the command line.
.Pp
The first occurrence of
.Ar /_
on the command line will be replaced with the absolute path of the first file
that was modified. If the restart option is used the first file under watch is
treated as the default.
.Ss FIFO Mode
The second mode also reads a list of filenames provided on STDIN and is enabled
by specifying
.Ql +
and the name of a fifo. In this mode
.Nm
enables more sophisticated scripting by writing filenames to a named pipe when
they are modified.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If
.Ev PAGER
is undefined,
.Nm entr
will assign
.Pa /bin/cat
to prevent interactive utilities from waiting for
keyboard input if output does not fit on the screen.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm entr
utility will exit with a value of 0 if the signal
.Dv SIGINT
or
.Dv SIGTERM
was received. If no regular files were provided
as input an exit status 1 is returned.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Rebuild project when source files change
.Pp
.Dl $ find src | entr make
.Pp
Clear the screen and run tests
.Pp
.Dl $ ls *.py  | entr -c ./test.py
.Pp
Launch and auto-reload a node.js server
.Pp
.Dl $ ls *.js | entr -r node app.js
.Pp

.Pp
Rebuild project if a source file is modified or added to the src/ directory
.Pp
.Dl $ while :; do
.Dl > 	ls src/*.rb | entr -d rake
.Dl > done
.Pp
