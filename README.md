Event Notify Test Runner
========================

A utility for running arbitrary commands when files change. Uses [kqueue(2)] or
[inotify(7)] to avoid polling.  `entr` was written to make rapid feedback and
automated testing natural and completely ordinary.

Rebuild a project if source files change, limiting output to the first 20 lines:

    $ find src/ | entr sh -c 'make | head -n 20'

Launch and auto-reload a node.js server:

    $ ls *.js | entr -r node app.js

Clear the screen and run a query after the SQL script is updated:
