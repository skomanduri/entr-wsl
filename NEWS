= Next Release: entr-2.8

 - Changed function pointer prefixes from '_' to 'x' to avoid name space
   collisions in libc. Required to build on DragonFlyBSD
 - Added NEWS file with more detailed release history
 - Using the argument '/_' on the command line is now replaced with the first
   file that changed

= Release History

== 2.6: January 23, 2014

 - Added -c option to clear the screen before calling execvp(3)
 - Change command line option '{}' to '/_'
 - Add Makefile.debian, a more complete replacement of Makefile.linux-lbsd
 - Include CPPFLAGS since some build systems use it to specify hardening criteria
 - Raise ARG_MAX from 4K to 2MB on Linux
 - Handle RENAME events that are not followed by DELETE. This enables us to cope
   with the backup option in Vim.

== 2.5: December 30, 2013

 - Restore full 50ms period for consolidating events on Linux. Required for the
   Geany editor
 - Remove use of setproctitle(3), no plans to implement this on Linux and MacOS
 - New feature: the first occurrence of '{}' on the command line will be
   replaced with the name of the first file under watch
 - Set PAGER to an absolute path; note the assignment of this variable in the
   man page
 - Prevent interactive utilities from paging output

== 2.4: December 18, 2013

 - Reintroduce ${DESTDIR} for STAGEDIR installation on FreeBSD and pkgsrc
 - License file describes the copyright holders for the compatibility libraries

== 2.3: December 12, 2013

 - Wait for processes to terminate in restart mode
 - Set process title for blocking events
 - Correct multiple bugs in the inotify->kqueue translation layer
 - Print out detailed instructions if the user provides configure arguments
 - Remove ${DESTDIR} from Makefile; this interferes with the OpenBSD port
 - Exception handler for SIGSEGV prints file name and line number if a unit test
   fails
 - Reduce the number of attempts to re-open files to 1 second (10 attempts)
 - Define architecture in Makefile instead of testing for __linux or __APPLE__

== 2.2: August 07, 2013

 - Process every delete or rename event to ensure files remain tracked
 - Always process DELETE or RENAME events to prevent a files from escaping watch
 - inotify(7) events are consolidated for a duration of 50ms as a workaround for
   a bug in glib/gio
 - Execute mode can run a file under watch by retrying if text file is busy
 - Exit non-zero if list of regular files exceeds the hard limit set by the
   current login class
 - Ignore directories and special files. Exit with error code 1 if no regular
   files are provided as input.

== 2.1: July 01, 2013

 - Zero-dependency build on Linux using built-in compatibility layer
 - Correct build on MacOS
 - Add poll with optional timeout in order to prevent change events from
   accumulating while running a command
 - Invalidate file->fd after inotify event is closed. Do not respond to
   IN_MOVE_SELF since this event only occurs on Linux NFS mounts
 - Optional build on GNU/Linux using external compatibility libraries libkqueue
   and libbsd
 - Regression tests PASS on Linux
 - Fix bug in finding the correct filename to write to a FIFO
 - Trial run at using a simplistic inotify-to-kueue notification layer instead
   of libkqueue

== 2.0: June 17, 2013

 - Support for old architectures without C99 support
 - More aggressively remove duplicate events
 - install/uninstall uses DESTDIR to be compatible with pkgsrc

== 1.9: April 13, 2013

 - New auto-reload option ('-r'). Thanks for Kevin Cox for the idea
 - Fix ./configure shell syntax for FreeBSD 9.0
   immediately and is sent SIGTERM if an file changes
 - Use a simple configure script, BSD is the default
 - Do not make install directories...they should already exist
 - Man page installation path can be set with MANPATH. MacOS expects it to be
   under /usr/local/share

== 1.8: May 12, 2013

 - Ensure that loosing a file under watch is results in an error

== 1.7: November 20, 3012

 - Allocate an array based on _SC_OPEN_MAX, not rl.rlim_max. Always terminate
   fgets(3) input at buffer boundary.
 - Stat deleted file until success before running a command
 - Handle SIGTERM and remove named pipe on exit

== 1.6: August 10, 2012

 - Separate makefile for Linux to make building easier
 - No need for pthreads on BSD
 - Respond to RENAME and LINK events to improve behavior on NFS

== 1.5: July 29, 2012

 - Support interactive applications by opening a TTY
 - Successfully stat deleted files before running a command

== 1.4: May 22, 2013

 - Added regression tests
 - Delete events instead of relying on implicit removal by close(2) for better
   compatibility with libkqueue on Linux

== 1.3: May 17, 2012

 - Added FIFO support. Thanks to James K. Lowden for the idea
 - Use min(OPEN_MAX, rl.rlim_max) to be more compatible of Mac OS. Better use of
   fgets(3) when reading STDIN

== 1.2: April 26, 2012

 - Added support for Linux via libkqueue

== 1.1: April 17, 2012

 - Added support for Mac OS

== 1.0: April 12, 2012

 - Initial release; builds on all major BSD platforms
